INTRO

We created this toolkit to simplify the process of creating a project proposal. We know that it can be hard to find templates, samples and guides all on one page. So, we compiled everything you might need to create a good project proposal in an easily digestible format!

If you are familiar with proposals please scroll to the templates and samples. If you’re not, please take a look at the About Project Proposals, Video Guides and Further Reading sections to find out more information.

This Toolkit was brought to you by Casual – a tool making project management simple.
